# WatchOSBreathingAnimation

#### Important: If you are using Xcode 12 beta and running on iOS 14 or macOS Big Sur, I have created a new branch with updated code You can check it out [here](https://github.com/Pondorasti/WatchOSBreathingAnimation/tree/ios14).

This is project is a recreation of Apple's breathing animation. I have created this to check out SwiftUI's capabilities and power when it comes to creating complex animations. If you are interested in the process of making this animation, you can check out my articles or watch my talk from WWDCWatchParty.
